# Advanced search

In the search page you can search for Intellectual Entities, Representations or Files (use the down arrow to select the search domain). For each one of these domains you can search in all its properties or in specific properties (use the down arrow to expand the advanced search). For example, if you select Intellectual Entities, you can search in a specific field of the descriptive metadata, or find files of a certain format if the Files advanced search is selected.

The search engine locates only whole words. If you want to search for partial terms you should use the '*' operator.

## Search operators

The following search operators are at your disposal:

- Exact sentence (e.g. "Miguel Ferreira")
- Terms begin with (e.g. Miguel F*)
- Ignore character (e.g. Miguel Ferreir?)
- Exclude term (e.g. -Miguel Ferreira)
- Similar terms (e.g. Ferreir~)
- Number range (e.g. 1900..2000)
- Term reunion (e.g. Miguel OR Ferreira)
