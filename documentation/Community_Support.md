# Community Support

You can find support from a variety of sources:

## Technical documentation

If youâ€™re stuck on a problem, someone else has probably encountered it too. Take a look at the [official documentation](README.md).

## Online forum

Use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/keeps/roda/issues/new?labels=question&title=I+have+a+question+about+RODA) functionality  to place your support questions. Someone from the open-source community will answer your question. Keep your query active until you get an answer or browse and search historical questions and answers.

## Professional support

If you are building a robust digital preservation environment you may need to resort to specialized professionals to help you out. If the free online support is just not sufficient for your needs and time constraints, you may want to consider hiring [Professional Support](Professional_Support.md).
