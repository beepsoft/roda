# Professional Support

We’re committed to providing the highest standard of service that empowers you to succeed in preserving your digital assets, on premises, in the cloud or anywhere in between. 

Professional Support is available as a single “pay-per-incident” (PPI) or anual support service. Professional Support incidents focus on troubleshooting a specific problem, error message, or functionality that is not working as intended. An incident is defined as a single support issue and the reasonable effort to resolve it. Incidents should be submitted online. Response time will be between 2 and 8 days, depending on severity of incident.
